# arduino-ir-controller

### Description
An Arduino infrared control implementation for the **Brightstar BR100P** remote. Built and tested on an Arduino Uno.

### TODO:
 - [ ] Remove debug logs (or hide behind flag)
 - [ ] Make more configuration agnostic (which servo is left or right, does it have an LED, etc.)
